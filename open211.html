    <p>Since late May 2011 one of the side projects during my fellowship at
      <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>has been developing <a href="http://open211.org">Open211.org</a> with
        <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tilgovi">Randall Leeds</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/briantrice">Brian Rice</a> and
          a few other contributors. Open211 is a set of software tools for collecting,
          managing and distributing social service information. My inspiration for
          working on the project comes from one of the great local resources from
          my hometown, Portland, OR: <a href="http://www.streetroots.org/">Street Roots</a>,
          who create jobs and media to support and educate the homeless population.
          They also distribute a ~100 page pocket directory of social programs biannually
          called the <a href="http://www.rosecityresource.org/">Rose City Resource.</a>
    </p>

      <p class="caption">A Rose City Resource printed guide</p>
    </div>
    <p>In a nutshell the Open211 project is attempting to introduce some of Tim
      O'Reilly's concepts of <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/"><em>Government as a Platform</em></a> to
      the traditionally closed data, proprietary software vendor dominated 211
      space. For instance in Boston the transit authority (MBTA) released real
      time data feeds for busses and trains in a way that was only consumable
      by software developers. The interesting part of this approach is that they
      didn't actually hire a contractor to write the user facing website or app,
      but instead let the community make applications. With some community outreach
      and PR surrounding the bus data release they ended up with over 200 different
      applications to access bus and train arrival times. I think that a similar
      thing could happen with social programs on a national scale.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of the project is to collect accurate directory level
      information (hours, location, services offered, phone etc) and then make
      data centrally available to three audiences:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Software developers</strong> - so that they can make software for
          accessing the data in new and interesting ways</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Social program employees</strong> - to accurately recommend or
          'redirect' patrons to other programs</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Social program recipients</strong> - accessed through text message,
          by receiving Rose City Resource style printed guides or through a variety
          of other means that will get created by developers</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are a lot of ways that this project could try to be more 'human',
      e.g. by providing feedback on services like Yelp, taking people in search
      of vocational training and pairing them with mentors, trying to track recidivism
      by allowing users to create profiles etc. but all of these things are mostly
      human problems and not technology problems and I'd rather not get too ambitious
      and complicated.</p>
    <p>All of my work is at this point free and open source and I'm happily getting
      compensated for this kind of work until at least the end of the year through
      the Code for America fellowship program. A highlight so far was being invited
      to the White House in Washington, D.C. to get honored by US Federal CTO
      Aneesh Chopra as an open data Champion of Change. Randall went and did
      the ole' dog and pony show and they made this <a href="http://www.govtech.com/e-government/White-House-Open-Data-Developers-Trade-Ideas.html#leeds">great video from the event.</a>
    </p>
    <p>We are currently seeking funding for this initiative so that we can hire
      part time data collection/software trainers/community evangelists in a
      few big cities to get Open211 deployed. At this point money for software
      development wouldn't help as I'm already taking on a full load of projects
      and have mostly built out the tools needed, now the limiting factor is
      real world usage so I'd like to get some people on the ground training
      programs how to use the tools and helping to collect directory information.</p>
