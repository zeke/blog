    <p>HTTP Unix pipes for Open Data</p>
    
<h1 id="not-invented-here">Not Invented Here</h1>

    <p>A topic that has fascinated me for years now is (broadly speaking) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism">nationalism</a>.
      In the world of the internet that essentially boils down to something like
      &quot;<em>I am a Python programmer and this project is written in Java! Ignored!&quot;</em>.
      It is this behavior (which I see a lot in programming, mostly manifested
      as &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">Not invented here</a>&quot;)
      that leads to a bunch of solutions to the same problem written in a bunch
      of different languages where many of the solutions are half-baked.</p>
    <p>For a concrete example consider open data catalogues. As evidenced by
      <a
      href="http://datacatalogs.org">datacatalogs.org</a>there are a ton of different solutions to the same
        set of problems, namely hosting open data. Having a rich ecosystem is a
        good thing, but I believe that there is a common open data infrastructure
        layer that we aren't maximizing our collaborating on: the conversion of
        data between different formats.</p>
    <p>Wouldn't it be great if I, as a Javascript developer, could use the awesome
      data conversion libraries available in Java like <a href="http://poi.apache.org">Apache POI</a>?
      Or if Ruby developers could use Python packages like <a href="https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit">csvkit</a> (which
      contains the super useful csvclean utility). The good news is that the
      internet has settled on a common language for crossing these language barriers:
      HTTP and JSON. Additionally, nowadays the web is filled with hosted services
      (see SaaS, PaaS). There are numerous platforms where hosted services can
      be deployed for free (Google App Engine, Heroku, Dotcloud, Nodejitsu, etc).</p>
    <h1
    id="unix-pipes">Unix pipes</h1>
      <p>On the Unix command line there are a bunch of useful single purpose utilities.
        The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> is <em>&quot;write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface&quot;</em>.
        The Unix command <code>wc</code> is a great example. You give it a bunch
        of text and it will count the number of words, lines and characters. Combined
        with the <code>cat</code> command, which reads and file and dumps out all
        the text, you can use a Unix pipe (the | character) to 'pipe' the data
        that <code>cat</code> dumps out into <code>wc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cat awesomeText.txt | wc
21      55     507</code></pre>

      
<h1 id="what-is-gut">What is gut</h1>

      <p>Taking heavy inspiration from unix pipes, HTTP and JSON I have come up
        with a modest proposal for how we might share our best tools for various
        data conversion jobs as hosted web services. I'm calling it gut, as in
        gutting a fish and getting the yummy filet out while leaving behind all
        of the junk.</p>
      <p>Here's a simple example of how a gut server would work that takes in a
        CSV file and returns JSON data. As a developer using the gut server to
        process my CSV file I would send the following HTTP request containing
        my CSV data:</p>
<pre><code>POST / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl
Host: gutcsv.nodejitsu.com
Accept: */*
Content-Length: 64
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name,appearance
chewbacca,hairy
bill,nonplussed
bubbles,relaxed</code></pre>

      <p>This is what the gut server would give me back:</p>
<pre><code>POST / HTTP/1.1
host: gutcsv.nodejitsu.com
content-type: application/json
content-length: 186
Connection: close
  
{
  &quot;headers&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;name&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;appearance&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;rows&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;chewbacca&quot;,
      &quot;appearance&quot;: &quot;hairy&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bill&quot;,
      &quot;appearance&quot;: &quot;nonplussed&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bubbles&quot;,
      &quot;appearance&quot;: &quot;relaxed&quot;
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

      <p>Essentially I am piping data from my computer through a gut server and
        when it comes back it is in the new format. In this example I used the
        node.js hosting platform Nodejitsu to deploy my CSV-to-JSON code so that
        it is available to anyone in the world who can make an HTTP request.</p>
      <h1
      id="voltron-assemble">Voltron, assemble!</h1>
        <p>If you are writing code that converts data from one format to another,
          consider also exposing your solution in the form of a gut server! Last
          year I had great success at <a href="http://opendataday.org">International Open Data Day</a> teachin
          ScraperWiki because it scaled out well to a room full of people with different
          programming backgrounds. I think that writing these lightweight data converters/massagers/transformer
          servers is also a task that anyone can tackle in a short amount of time.</p>
        <p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/gut">Github project</a> that
          contains the current gut servers that I have been working on and also a
          <a
          href="https://github.com/maxogden/gut/wiki/List-of-gut-servers">wiki page</a>where you can add your gut server to the list. Once there
            are a handful of gut servers we can start working on more extensive discovery
            and testing tools (ensuring gut server availability, better documentation,
            web based gut server API playground, etc).</p>
