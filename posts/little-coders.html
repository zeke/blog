    <p>Elementary school programming</p>
    <p>My first foray into programming was in 1999 and happened accidentally
      inside the Starcraft custom level editor. I would sit, fully <a href="http://cyborganthropology.com/Paracosmic_Immersion">immersed in a paracosm</a>,
      and create complex storylines that the player could play through, one small
      objective at a time. You could specify, for instance, that if a Zergling
      walks onto a particular platform then an event should trigger. You could
      subscribe other elements of the game to listen for events on that platform
      and perform other callbacks. I was getting exposed to event based publish/subscribe
      asynchronous programming without realizing it.</p>

    <p>When my older brother asked me how to get his nine year old interested
      in programming, I told him to look for a programming environment that sacrifices
      practicality for imagination. Nine year olds aren't worried about vendor
      lock in or job security, they are only going to get hooked if the feel
      like they are playing a video game (in my case with Starcraft I was literally
      playing a video game). A good example of this mentality is <a href="http://hacketyhack.heroku.com/">Hackety Hack</a> by
      _why the lucky stiff. Hackety Hack aims to &quot;offer a place for plainspeople
      to tinker with code&quot;. Here is a wonderful video from the <a href="http://www.flong.com/projects/artandcode/">Art &amp;&amp; Code Symposium</a> where
      _why talks about his thoughts on programming education for youngsters and
      shows off Hackety Hack. <a href="http://vimeo.com/5047563">Highly recommended viewing.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Near the end of the above video, _why describes a card game called Kaxxt
      that is designed to get little coders introduced to fundamental programming
      concepts. At it's core Kaxxt is about robots, lazers and pyramids. What
      nine year old wouldn't want to play that? When kids play this game they
      get exposed to ideas such as enumerability or thinking recursively, much
      in the same fashion that <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=4825">The Little Schemer</a> tries
      to &quot;present abstract concepts in a humorous and easy-to-grasp fashion&quot;.
      The Flash game <a href="http://armorgames.com/play/2205/light-bot">Lightbot</a> also
      comes to mind. In Lightbot, you visually program an animated robot through
      a series of puzzles. It seems that robots and lazers may be the key to
      connecting with today's youth.</p>
    <p>Sadly, _why mysteriously stopped contributing to his projects at some
      point in 2009, leaving many orphaned works behind. His projects have been
      adopted by various open source community members. <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2010/11/17/the-hardest-decision-i-ve-ever-made.html">Steve Klabnik</a> recently
      quit his job to courageously follow his heart and work on Hackety Hack
      full time. Similarly, <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/">Joey Hess</a> then
      took the liberty of creating an alpha, playtestable version of Kaxxt that
      uses the pieces from the board game <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/225/icehouse">Icehouse</a>.
      His port is called '<a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/kaxxt/">Kaxxt on Ice</a>'</p>
    <p>There are also a few notable academic programming education efforts.
      <a
      href="http://www.greenfoot.org/">Greenfoot</a>is designed to teach kids Java. There is an entertaining
        <a
        href="http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/mik/2008/01/20/teaching-my-daughter-to-code/">series of posts</a>from a programmer who tried teaching his nine year
          old daughter how to program using Greenfoot. Google has been lightly researching
          alternative curriculum designs through their <a href="http://www.google.com/educators/index.html">Google for Educators</a> program.
          As described by Google's director of education relations in the tech talk
          &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz4ZgC_A77g">Initiatives in Education</a>&quot;,
          Google has been working on &quot;integrating computing curriculum across
          K-12 core subjects&quot;. They also recently donated 2 million USD to Sal
          Khan's <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, which offers
          a staggering amount of free, digestible education lectures.</p>
    <p>MIT's <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and Carnegie Mellon's
      Alice seem to each have years of development poured into them, as well
      as some friendly competitionand actual in-classroom testing. At first glance,
      both Scratch and Alice appear deep and involved, much like a complicated
      programming IDE. I would personally like to see more lightweight artistic
      interpretations, mockups and spikes of the PhD level programming educational
      research that is happening between Google, MIT, Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere.
      In the Hackety Hack Manifesto it is explictly stated that&quot;IDEs are
      a disaster. Newbs should see only one non-scary window free of tree controls
      and pinned windows and toolbars. As such, we want to stay away from project
      files and makefiles, the trappings of an IDE.&quot;</p>
    <p>As part of my fellowship with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> in
      2011 I will be working with the city of Boston on software to improve public
      school education (more details <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2010/11/19/2011-projects-overview-video-and-deck/">here</a>).
      I am excited at the prospect of getting to meet those working on Scratch
      at MIT or researchers from the <a href="http://www.concord.org/">Concord Consortium</a>.</p>
