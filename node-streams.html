<h1 id="why-streams">Why Streams?</h1>

    <p>node bills itself as <em>JavaScript evented I/O</em>. In a nutshell that
      means if you are trying to solve a problem that is <em>I/O bound</em> (the
      limiting factor is reading/writing to relatively slow interfaces) then
      node can provide some useful abstractions to you. An example is if you
      are writing an application that has to talk to multiple databases, a caching
      layer, a load balancer, external web services, mobile clients, third party
      auth providers and serve web applications then node acts as a nice glue
      between all of the things.</p>
    <p><em>&quot;Streams in node are one of the rare occasions when doing something the fast way is actually easier. SO USE THEM. not since bash has streaming been introduced into a high level language as nicely as it is in node.&quot;</em>
    </p>
    <p><em>-</em><a href="http://twitter.com/dominictarr">@dominictarr</a> in
      his <a href="https://gist.github.com/2401787">high level node style guide</a>
    </p>
    
<h1 id="what-are-streams">What are Streams?</h1>

    <p>The main tool in node's evented toolbox is the <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html">Stream</a>.
      Stream instances are basically Unix pipes. They can be readable, writable
      or both and are easy to reason about -- you can pipe a readable stream
      to a writable stream by doing <code data-language="javascript">readableStream.pipe(writableStream)</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="readable">Readable</h2>
      <p>Readable streams will emit <code>data</code> events each time they get a
        &quot;chunk&quot; of data and then they will emit <code>end</code> when they
        are all finished. emit (from <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/events.html">EventEmitter</a>)
        is the observer pattern - a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number
        of observer objects to see an event. Different types of streams will have
        different ways of chunking up their data. For example, a library that reads
        CSVs might emit <code>data</code> every time it reads a new line whereas
        an HTTP request might emit <code>data</code> every few kilobytes during the
        download.</p>
      <p>Readable streams can also be paused and resumed, and it's up to the Stream
        implementer to write the <code>pause()</code> and <code>resume()</code> methods.
        Pause is intended to be an advisory API meaning when you call it you are
        telling the stream to stop emitting <code>data</code> events but you may
        still receive some <code>data</code> events after you call pause because
        certain things may already <em>in-flight</em>, or between states at the
        moment you called pause.</p>
      
<h2 id="writable">Writable</h2>

      <p>Writable streams must implement two functions: <code>write</code> and <code>end</code>.
        When you write data to a writable stream it will return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. <code>true</code> means <em>cool, keep sending more data with write</em> and <code>false</code> means <em>Uh-oh I am backed up -- don't write any more data until I emit drain</em>.</p>
      <p>This is a form of <em>back pressure</em> which is a very powerful feature
        as it lets stream communicate &quot;upstream&quot; to their writers. Most
        of the back pressure related APIs are advisory so there is sort of a gentlemens
        agreement to honor requests to start or stop writing as timely as possible.
        However, since they are advisory it means a writable stream may still receive <code>write</code> calls
        after it returns <code>false</code>.</p>
      
<h1 id="streams-on-the-client">Streams on the client</h1>

      <p>After working with node for a while I came to love the Stream API (
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/2401787">and I'm not the only one</a>) but sorely missed it when I had to deal
          with the variety of I/O bound APIs in the client side realm. Some examples
          of these are XHR, WebSockets, IndexedDB, WebWorkers, WebRTC, and DOM Events
          (mouse, touch, etc). Wouldn't it be great if you could use the same node
          style Stream semantics to interface with all of these things? Unfortunately
          it seems that standards bodies have instead implemented their own (usually
          inconsistent or poorly done) streaming semantics for the client.</p>
      <p>I thought it would be useful to write something like <code data-language="javascript">fingerSwipe.pipe(webSocket)</code> (pseudo-code
        for detecting swipe <code>touch</code> events and streaming them to the server
        as they happen over a WebSocket connection) so I started a project called
        <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/domnode/">domnode</a>which intends to wrap common I/O bound APIs in node style streams
          so that you can render them into the DOM easily.</p>
      <p>There is a magical project by <a href="http://twitter.com/substack">@substack</a> called
        <a href="http://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a>that makes domnode possible. It lets you write code in client
          side JS that looks like node code:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">var stream = require(&#39;stream&#39;)
var util = require(&#39;util&#39;)
   
function XHRStream(xhr) {
  stream.Stream.call(this)
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function () { me.handle() }
  xhr.send(null)
}

util.inherits(XHRStream, stream.Stream)</code></pre>

      <p>The best part about browserify is that it avoids reinventing the wheel/not
        invented here by letting you use the pure JavaScript parts of node or thousands
        of third party modules while maintaining node's simplified require API.
        Since browserify uses node's source code verbatim you get to use the
        <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">node documentation</a>as well as the multitude of related information
          floating around on the internets to look up how these things work.</p>
      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/dominictarr">@dominictarr</a> contributed a
        Stream wrapper for Socket.io called <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/browser-stream">browser-stream</a> that
        nicely integrates with domnode so you can emit things from node and rest
        assured that they will make their way into your web app.</p>
      
<h1 id="streams.next">Streams.next</h1>

      <p>As wonderful as streams are today, they can definitely use some improvements.
        <a href="http://twitter.com/izs">@izs</a>tells me node v0.9 is going to feature a major Stream overhaul
          to make the API even more unified. When node started it created a few domain
          specific evented I/O abstractions for things like the filesystem or TCP
          and then later, around 0.4, it consolidated them into the Stream API we
          have today, but there are still some vestigial phantoms lurking around.</p>
      <p>One of the major blemishes is the collection of methods used end a stream. <code>destroy()</code> initiates
        a forceful end to a stream, whereas <code>destroySoon()</code> and <code>end()</code> both
        wait for the current data to finish buffering. <code>end()</code> and <code>destroySoon()</code> came
        from different parts of node originally but after being consolidated into
        Streams they have some overlap and can probably be redesigned.</p>
      <p>There is also some confusion between the <code>close</code> and <code>end</code> events. <code>end</code> means <em>no more data will be emitted but if this stream is also writable it should stay open for more writes if they need to happen</em> and <code>close</code> means <em>whatever this thing was tied to, it's done now. you may dispose of it, it's gone</em>.
        Close comes from the <code>fs.close()</code> method and end is tied to the <code>end()</code> function
        on Streams and as you can see these can probably be refactored.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is that streams will get automagic buffering. This
        means that if you create a writable stream but haven't yet piped it anywhere
        then it will buffer any data you write to it and then emit that data when
        someone asks for it later. This same behavior will be available if you
        pause a stream and then resume later. Currently you have to roll your own
        buffered stream implementation or use a generic third party module like
        <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/morestreams/blob/master/main.js">BufferedStream</a>by <a href="http://twitter.com/mikeal">@mikeal</a>.</p>
