    <p>Some experiments in collecting images + location from mobile devices</p>
    <p>Over the last couple of years I've been fascinated with technology that
      collects and aggregates mappable information. Specifically I have been
      searching for or creating tools that have these properties:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Lets users discover things near them, allows submission of location, photos
          and text</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Built on an open data API so that others can access and build on the data</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Easy for new developers to clone and deploy the app. A big roadblock on
          this front has been the Apple App Store. $100 and weeks of back and forth
          just to publish a public data app that uploads photos? Rubbish.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>My first foray into &quot;civic web&quot; applications was in the form
      of a project called Portland Smells, which was a map-wiki that collected
      smelly places (both good and bad) and threw them on a map.</p>
    <div class="figure">
      <img src="http://substance-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/19/65ca390f66b525383a3779dc12844c/psmells.png" alt="The now defunct www.portlandsmells.com">
      <p class="caption">The now defunct www.portlandsmells.com</p>
    </div>
    <p>Portland Smells was meant to be more of an art project than a public utility.
      That is, until a local government representative contacted me regarding
      a project that was being built out (now available at <a href="http://www.whatsinourair.org/">whatsinourair.org</a>)
      to help report and monitor illegal chemical dump sites in the Portland
      area. Apparently the functionality created for Portland Smells was greatly
      needed for social and environmental justice. Needless to say I got hooked
      on the idea of open data.</p>
    
<h1 id="from-smells-to-carts-and-cats">From smells to carts and cats</h1>

    <p>After mapping smells I took a stab at an application to map <a href="http://www.foodcartsportland.com/">food carts</a> that
      also allowed users to keep food cart locations, menus and hours of operation
      up to date. The app was made in early 2010 (<a href="https://github.com/maxogden/pdx-food-carts-mobile">code here</a>)
      using the Titanium Mobile framework and used <a href="http://pdxapi.com">PDX API</a> as
      the backend. Unfortunately Microsoft also decided to <a href="http://spinnerin.tumblr.com/post/1014484948/why-contribute-to-a-community-project-when-you-can">release a closed source</a> food
      cart application (with a huge marketing budget) which effectively killed
      my excitement about the cart mapping project.</p>
    <div class="figure">
      <img src="http://substance-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7d/5ba7d7b536bf39861123d0d043e2ee/Screen-Shot-2011-07-29-at-5.23.43-PM.png" alt="The now defunct CartsPDX">

    <p>Developing a cross platform mobile application using <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/">Titanium</a> had
      it's fair share of speedbumps, including buggy tools, lack of features
      and weird javascript DSLs. I would imagine that now, a year and a half
      later, a lot of these issues have been addressed.</p>
    <p>Then I got <a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/print-article-12542-print.html">obsessed with cats</a>.
      While walking around neighborhoods in Portland you will run into them all
      over the freaking place. I started to wonder if certain cats were always
      out on porches and what neighborhoods had the highest cat density. Someone
      told me that if the humane society had access to cat density data then
      they could better target spaying and neutering education initiatives. I
      started <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/tag:catmapper">recording videos</a> of
      cats that I found while walking around and prototyped a pure webapp CartsPDX-like
      interface using jQuery Mobile: <a href="http://catmapper.com">catmapper.com</a>
    </p>

<h1 id="collecting-photos">Collecting photos</h1>

    <p>The biggest tradeoff to consider when building mobile web apps vs. native
      apps is the inability of most mobile web browsers to natively upload photos.
      Generally speaking native applications require more commitment from the
      application developer but provide a better user experience. Here I will
      share some different approaches to the problem of collecting photos and
      locations</p>
    
<h2 id="wrapping-web-apps-in-native-functionality-with-phonegaptitanium">Wrapping web apps in native functionality with Phonegap/Titanium</h2>

    <p>Rather than learning Objective-C and Java I would strongly prefer to stick
      to my high level dynamic language of choice, JavaScript. Both <a href="https://github.com/phonegap">Phonegap</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator">Titanium</a>provide a JavaScript DSL that abstracts native functionality
        for the developer and has the ability to 'compile' to multiple mobile platforms.</p>
    <p>Personally I am more a fan of Phonegap because of the team's commitment
      to support and foster HTML5 and their ultimate goal of making Phonegap
      itself obsolete through cross platform open web standards. This also results
      in more of a &quot;modern&quot; JavaScript feel than what Titanium offers.</p>
    <p>Regardless of which tools you choose to create native applications, the
      most tedious part will always be registering app store developer licenses,
      packaging and submitting applications for approval.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/andrewgleave/OpenElm">OpenElm</a> Project
      is a great open source Phonegap application built using jQuery Mobile for
      the UI and CouchDB on the server. Andrew Gleave, lead developer on the
      project, even went the extra mile and wrote an <a href="https://github.com/andrewgleave/CouchDBAttachmentUploader">attachment uploader plugin</a> for
      iOS Phonegap devices that makes uploading files and photos super smooth.</p>
    <div class="figure">

<h2 id="email-submissions">Email Submissions</h2>

      <p>Many smartphones can interpret mailto: links and launch email composition
        forms pre-loaded with the recipient address from the mailto:. On Android
        devices users are given the option of adding attachments to an existing
        message, but on iOS there is no way to add an attachment to a message being
        composed - you have to start the interaction by visiting the photo browser
        and choosing 'Share', however there is no way to initialize the photo sharing
        interface from a mobile web app. This severely complicates the UX for iOS
        users.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the UX complications, email can be a nice and simple way
        to offer photo submissions without going through the rigamarole of registering
        native developer credentials. There are two ways that I've tried initiating
        email submissions</p>
      
<h3 id="visiting-a-mobile-web-app-first-and-being-given-a-mailto-link">Visiting a mobile web app first and being given a mailto: link</h3>

      <p>Catmapper.com (source), a prototype application, is an example of first
        collecting location and then providing an email address where photos can
        be submitted later. The requires that users remember to visit catmapper.com
        when they are walking down the street and visit a cat, and also that they
        are able to take an email address from a website and successfully email
        photos to it.</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="http://substance-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cb/3ad60ae34b1ac58234e55c7f7806b8/Screen-Shot-2011-07-29-at-5.53.32-PM.png" alt="Catmapper Prototype">
        <p class="caption">Catmapper Prototype</p>

<h3 id="sending-photos-to-a-particular-email-address-first-and-receiving-instructions-in-a-reply-email">Sending photos to a particular email address first and receiving instructions in a reply email</h3>

      <p>Pictured below is another now defunct prototype that was meant to demonstrate
        how defibrillator locations might be submitted by thoughtful citizens who
        encounter them. First the smartphone must have GPS enabled so that the
        photos contain coordinates in the embedded EXIF data. Photos are emailed
        in and users will receive a response email containing a visualization of
        the GPS coordinates from the EXIF information. Upon tapping on the map
        they are taken to a catmapper-style mobile interface that lets them update
        the specific coordinates for their submission.</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="http://substance-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a8/b4d051dc6477185ac39f861f9539b2/Screen-Shot-2011-07-29-at-6.12.44-PM.png" alt="AED Mapper prototype">
        <p class="caption">AED Mapper prototype</p>
      </div>
      <p>This particular email processing workflow was implemented using a Ruby
        server that accessed a gmail account through IMAP. You can get the code
        by visiting the older commits in <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/aedmapper">this repository</a>.
        Warning: trying to write a realtime IMAP client for Gmail was pretty painful
        and prompted me to write a realtime node.js email processor, <a href="http://github.com/maxogden/haraka-couchdb">haraka-couchdb</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="tweets-with-geolocation-and-photos">Tweets with geolocation and photos</h2>
        <p>There are tons of native Twitter applications that allow uploading to
          third party image sharing services like yfrog or twitpic. Some colleagues
          of mine at Code for America took a <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/muralmapper">Node.js daemon</a> from
          civic hacker Mark Headd and extended it to save images + latitude/longitude
          from tweets into CouchDB. This approach requires users to enable geolocation
          in their Twitter client. It also has an interesting social property that
          can photo sharing engagement.</p>
        <div class="figure">

<h2 id="mms-gateways">MMS Gateways</h2>

        <p>This would be super cool for bridging the gap from smartphones to feature
          phones but unfortunately is not supported by the major telephony API providers
          (Twilio and Tropo).</p>
        
<h2 id="desktop-uploading">Desktop uploading</h2>

        <p>Photos often don't need to be uploaded in the field and can be synced
          and uploaded at a later time. This broadens the range of cameras that can
          be used to capture images and lets users without smartphones participate
          in using your application. Here is another prototype, <a href="http://aedmapper.com/">aedmapper.com</a> (
          <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/aedmapper">code here</a>), that is meant to show how to collect accurate information
            about defibrillator locations using address autocompletion, web based mapping
            and drag and drop photo upload forms.</p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="http://substance-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/43/af19e69b4d2d349432e055a134840f/Screen-Shot-2011-07-29-at-6.41.03-PM.png">
          <p class="caption"></p>
        </div>
        <p>Using the same code I created two separate <a href="http://open211.org/#upload">upload forms</a> for
          another project, Open211, a directory of social services. One form collects
          locations while the other offers dropbox-like attachment uploading functionality.</p>
        <div class="figure">

<h2 id="pen-paper">Pen + Paper</h2>

          <p>The most ubiquitous mobile crowdsourcing interface comes in the form of
            <a href="http://walking-papers.org/">walking papers</a>, a project by Michal Migurski. Designed as a tool for
              collecting data for OpenStreetMap, the computer vision technology that
              powers walking papers could also prove useful for large scale low technology
              data collection deployments. I haven't yet had a chance to use this tech
              but am itching at the opportunity.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="http://substance-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/3d/36cd4193c7bd70371e4ca41da172ab/5042873815_d1f17898fb_z.png" alt="www.flickr.com/photos/harrywood/5042873815/">

          <p>OpenStreetMap contributors have gathered for <em>mapping parties,</em> which
            consist of treks through unmapped neighborhoods where participants document
            what they see by writing down landmarks, roads, parks and playgrounds on
            a special map that can be scanned and uploaded to walking-papers.org where
            they are then georectified and traced directly onto OpenStreetMap.</p>
